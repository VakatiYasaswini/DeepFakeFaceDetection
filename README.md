# DeepFakeFaceDetection
This project focuses on generating deep fake facial images using machine learning, leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks alongside deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to synthesize realistic facial expressions and movements by training the model on sequential image data.
